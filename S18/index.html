						<strong>A Note About Quiz Days:</strong> I expect that everyone is working through the suggested problems in the book. On quiz days,
								I will spend the first few minutes of class discussing <strong>specific problems from the book that you wish to review (e.g., "I struggled with Problem 15 in Section 1.5. Can you review this?").
								I will NOT pick problems from the book to cover in class, as it eats up valuable review time and this is really your responsibility.

					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/28:</strong> The Final Exam is cumulative and scheduled for May 8 at 9:00 AM in the usual classroom.
					There will be 110 possible points on the Final Exam, with 80 points from multiple choice (20 problems at 4 points each) and 30 points from
					free-response questions (3 problems at 10 points each). <strong>There will be particular emphasis on optimization problems (Chapter 4)</strong>,
					as this material is particularly useful and relevant.
					The <a href="Missed_Exam_Questions.pdf">extra credit problems</a> handed out in class 
					last week (4/24, and again 4/26) can add additional points to your final exam score. I will extend the deadline on these to <strong>5/3 at 5 PM</strong>. <br/>
					
					<p>All the WileyPlus homeworks have been re-opened. You can increase your score on them between now and 5/7 at 11:55 PM. This is also a good way
					of studying for the final. </p>
					
					I only had two responses to the office hours survey. Therefore, my office hours during finals week will be as requested: 5/2 from 3-4 PM, and 5/3 from 4-5 PM.
					I will also have normal office hours on Monday 4/30; note that 4/30 will be my last day of normal office hours.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/17:</strong> 
						Here are the <a href="Quiz13_0417_Solutions.pdf">solutions</a> to today's quiz. HW15 was extended to 4/18 at 7:30 PM. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/12:</strong> 
						HW14 was posted on 4/10 and is due on 4/17 at 2:00 AM. HW15 was posted today and is due at 11:55 PM on 4/17. We will have a quiz over sections 5.2-5.6 and 6.4
						on Tuesday. There will be 20 possible points on this quiz, and you will be graded out of 10 points. The Section 6.4 problems can be a little long-winded, and this
						provides practice with less pressure. It is also an opportunity to make up a little lost ground. Even though HW15 is due at 11:55 PM on 4/17, it will directly benefit
						you on the quiz to have made significant progress prior to the start of class. 
						
						<p>As Section 6.4 is clear as mud, I prepared some <a href="Section_6.4_Notes.pdf">notes</a> to help you.</p>
						
						<p>Exam 3 is on Thursday 4/19 and will cover sections 4.3-4.4, 5.1-5.6, 6.1-6.2, and 6.4.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/3:</strong> 
						HW12 has been extended to 4/4 at 11:55 PM. There will be a quiz over 4.3-4.4 and 5.1 (Left-Hand Sums) on Thursday 4/5.
						HW13 is now posted, and it is due on 4/10 at 2:00 AM. Additionally, there will be a quiz on Tuesday 4/10 over HW13 (Sections 5.1, 6.1, and 6.2). 
					
						<p>Exam 3 is scheduled for 4/19. </p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/1:</strong> There will be a quiz over 4.3-4.4 on Tuesday 4/3. </li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/27:</strong> HW12, covering 4.3-4.4, is now posted. It is due on 4/3 at 2:00 AM. You should be able to get started. </li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/20:</strong> Here are the <a href="Quiz9_0320_Solutions.pdf">solutions</a> to today's quiz. You are 
					welcome to pick up your graded quizzes tomorrow in office hours.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/19:</strong> The MyMathLab homework due on 3/20 is due at 11:55 PM. Also, here is an <a href="Optimization_WS.pdf">optimization worksheet</a>
					to help review the first and second derivative tests, as well as points of inflection. We will cover the second derivative test tomorrow, and this will be on the Exam on Thursday.
					</li>
					
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/6:</strong> I typed up the <a href="FDT_Example.pdf">example from class today</a>. Please make sure to review it
					before Thursday. On Thursday, we will have a quiz over 2.3-2.4. We also need to finish covering 4.1-4.2 on Thursday. <br/> 
					
					There will be a homework assignment, posted tonight, on 2.5, 4.1, and 4.2. It will be due on 2:00 AM before class on 3/20. There will be a quiz over
					2.5, 4.1, and 4.2 on 2/20 at the <strong>start of class!</strong> If you are late, you will not be able to take the quiz on 2/20. I will go over the quiz right after we take it and have it graded for you to pick
					up in my office hours on Wednesday. Exam 2 will be on Thursday 3/22, covering 2.1-2.5, 3.3-3.4, and 4.1-4.2.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/27:</strong>
						HW10 covering 2.3-2.4 is posted and due on 3/6 at 2:00 AM. Note: there are problems providing a function's value at a point f(c) as well as
						the value f'(c), which ask you to approximate f(x) at some other value. (E.g., Given f(5) = 20 and f'(5) = 2, approximate f(10)). These require
						you to use the tangent line approximation we discussed in class today. <br/>
						
						Today's quiz is also graded. Folks still seem to struggle with the product, quotient, and chain rules. So there will be another quiz on Thursday 3/1
						over this material. It is important that you master this material prior to the exam!
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/24:</strong>
						There will be a quiz over 2.1-2.2 and the Product/Quotient/Chain Rules on 2/27. Also, Exam 2 will be after Spring Break. However,
						there will be a quiz on 3/8, the last day we meet before Spring Break.  
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/20:</strong> Today's <a href="Quiz5_0220.pdf">quiz</a> is now a take-home homework assignment, due on 2/22 (next class). It is open-note and open-book, and 
						you are welcome to consult with your classmates. However, <strong>ALL WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.</strong> In particular, <strong>you must write
						up your solutions individually.</strong> The next WileyPlus assignment is also up and due on 2/27. You have enough to begin working at least the graph problems on WileyPlus.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/15:</strong> 
						HW7, covering 3.3-3.4, is now available on WileyPlus. It is due at 2:00 AM on 2/20. There will be a quiz in class over 3.3-3.4 
						on 2/20. The worksheet from today over the product, quotient, and chain rules is posted under the suggested problems. <br/>
						
						My Tuesday office hours have changed. I will now hold Tuesday office hours from 12-1 in LC 105.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/8:</strong> Attached are the solutions to <a href="Quiz4_0208.pdf">today's quiz.</a> You are welcome to 
					pick up your graded quiz on Monday during my office hours. Remember that Exam 1 is on Tuesday 2/13. 
					<strong>THE EXAM CANNOT BE MADE UP, EXCEPT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WITH DOCUMENTATION. OVERSLEEPING IS NOT AN EMERGENCY! YOU ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE EXAM ON 2/13.</strong>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/7:</strong> 
						Remember that Exam 1 is on 2/13. It covers 1.1-1.8 and 3.1-3.2. Tomorrow is a review day. After the quiz, you will have the rest of class
						to work on what you need to study. Come prepared! I will be happy to answer questions.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/6:</strong> 
						HW6 covering 3.1-3.2 is now on WileyPlus. The due date is 2/8 at 2 AM. The quiz on 2/8 will be over 3.1-3.2, so the homework is there to 
						help you prepare for the quiz. As I announced in class: if, in my judgement, the class as a whole has made reasonable progress on the homework,
						I will extend the deadline to Sunday evening. Please note that working only a couple of questions is not sufficient to be considered reasonable progress. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/2:</strong> 
						On 2/6, we will begin learning how to compute derivatives. This will be the last new material before Exam 1, which is scheduled for Tuesday 2/13.
						On 2/8, we will have a quiz over the material from 2/6 at the <strong>start of class, which cannot be made up if you are late</strong>. This is 
						intended to be a short, easy quiz to provide you timed practice before the exam. After the quiz on 2/8, you will have the rest of class to review
						and ask me questions. I will post solutions to the 2/8 quiz to the course website later that day, and you can pick up your graded quiz on Monday during office hours.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/1:</strong> HW5 over section 1.8 is posted and due on 2/6 at 2:00 AM. We will have a quiz on 2/6 over sections 1.7 and 1.8.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/29:</strong> We will have a quiz over sections 1.4-1.6 on Thursday, 2/1. HW4 over section 1.7 is now posted on WileyPlus; it is due on 2/6 at 2:00 AM. </li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/28:</strong> The Math tutoring center (LC 105) is open starting tomorrow. It is staffed Monday-Thursday from 10-4 with graduate students,
					who are there to help you for free! </li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/25:</strong> HW3 on WileyPlus is due on 1/30 at 2:00 AM.</li> 
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/22:</strong> HW2 on WileyPlus is due on 1/25 at 2:00 AM. We will have a quiz on 1/25 covering sections 1.1-1.3.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/17:</strong> HW1 on WileyPlus is due on 1/23 at 2:00 AM.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>1/16:</strong> My official office hours will be set once the Math Tutoring Center 
						schedule is set. In the interim, my temporary office hours will be on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:00-2:00 PM.
						I am also available by appointment.
