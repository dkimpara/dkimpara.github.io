There is also a bonus HW over 10.8, due on 4/29 at 4:00 PM. The bonus HW will replace your lowest HW grade (effectively, Blackboard will drop one homework grade).</li>
						
						<li>If it is to your advantage, the Final Exam will replace your lowest midterm exam grade.</li>
						<li>We will have bonus quizzes on 4/23 and 4/25. Each bonus quiz can replace your (next) lowest quiz grade (effectively, Blackboard will drop an additional quiz grade for each bonus quiz we have). The bonus quizzes are optional, but highly encouraged. Their purpose is to provide you with timely feedback and practice before the final exam.</li>

We will have a quiz on solving differential equations on 4/3. Then on 4.4, there will be a quiz on 5.3/5.4, emphasizing applications of integration and the second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
						</li>
						
						<li>HW17 over 5.4 is now posted. It is also due on 4/4 (along with HW16), but I have intentionally kept HW17 short.</li>

						<li>HW14 has been extended to 3/28 at 4:00 PM. Given that the quiz on 3/26 will cover 4.4, you should make every effort to

						<li>After discussing the matter in class, it was decided that Exam 3 will be held on April 17, rather than April 22. 
							The precise contents of Exam 3 will be determined at a later point, based on the material we cover. With that said,
							sections 5.6 and 6.2 will decidedly <strong>not</strong> be on Exam 3. Both 5.6 and 6.2 will be on the final exam, and 
							you will have some sort of timed practice (e.g., a quiz) on this material prior to the final exam.

						<li>Exam 2 will be returned on Monday in class. There will be test corrections for Exam 2 due on 3/25, and they will count as a homework grade. Here are the stipulations.
						<ul>
							<li>You must redo every part of Problem 4 for which you did not receive full credit.</li>
							<li>Pick one problem (other than Problem 1 or Problem 4) to redo.</li>
							<li>For each problem you redid (any part of Problem 4, as well as the problem you picked), you must write a reflection. The reflection should discuss any clear, technical misconceptions or background knowledge you lacked (and in more detail than <em>I didn't study</em> or <em>I didn't know the quotient rule.</em>) You should then (in clear and thorough detail) discuss what you learned.</li>
							
							<li><strong>You must STAPLE OR PAPERCLIP your corrections to your exam.</strong> Your work will otherwise not be accepted.</li>

						<li>We will have a quiz over 3.10 on Monday 3/4. I will have this quiz graded by recitation on Tuesday 3/5, for Stephen to hand back.
							So while recitation on 3/5 will be a review day, attendance will be taken.

							questions on HW9 prior to 2/26.
						</li>
						
						<li>Looking ahead, Exam 2 will be on March 6. It will tentatively cover 3.1-3.10 and 4.1-4.2. Stephen will be

							The quiz on using the derivative rules has been moved to 2/21.
						</li>
						
						<li>For Monday 2/25, please redo one exam question which you <strong>attempted</strong>. Please turn in your revised attempt,
							your exam, and a reflection. Your reflection should include discussion on why your initial attempt was incorrect, as well as
							a clear and detailed exposition of what you learned. Such details include, but are not limited to: citing specific techniques and approaches, and identifying previous misconceptions/confusions and discussing how you corrected them.

						<li>On Thursday 2/14 in recitation, Stephen will introduce the Binomial Theorem and use it to prove the power rule for 
							positive integers. The Binomial Theorem is useful in efficiently expanding out binomials (i.e., without foiling). It will
							also come up in your Probability class later. Attendance will be taken on Thursday, and it will count for a quiz grade. 
						</li>
						
						<li>HW7 over 3.1-3.5 will go online on 2/13 after Exam 1. It is due on 2/19 at 4:00 PM. There will be a quiz on 
							3.1-3.2 (the limit definition of the derivative) on 2/19 in recitation. On 2/20 in class, we will have a short
							quiz on the using the derivative rules to compute basic derivatives. You will <strong>not</strong> be using the limit
							definition for the 2/20 quiz.

					</li>
					
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>2/3:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>On Monday, the goal is to cover 2.5-2.6. We will have a quiz over 2.5-2.6 on Wednesday, at the end of class.
								This will allow me to grade the quizzes, so that Stephen can hand them back in recitation on Thursday.
								Stephen will also have your 2.3 quizzes graded for Thursday as well.
							</li>
							
							<li>HW6 over 2.5-2.6 goes online tomorrow at 4:00 PM. It is due on Saturday 2/9 at 11:59 PM, so that you have time
								to complete the assignment. I would suggest attempting as much of HW6 as you are able ahead of Wednesday's quiz,
								so that you can ask questions in office hours and are prepared for the quiz.
							</li>
							
							<li>Here is the <a href="WS_2.5-2.6.pdf">Study Guide for 2.5-2.6.</a></li>

						<li>Here is the <a href="WS_1.5-2.2.pdf">study guide</a> for sections 1.5-1.6 and the first part of section 2.2. We will
							be covering these sections on 1/23. Please look over the problems as soon as you are able, so that you have a better
							idea of where you stand before class on Wednesday and so you can ask for help on Thursday in recitation.
						</li>
						
						<li>There will be a short quiz on evaluating the six basic trig functions (sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot) along the unit circle. 
							The quiz will likely resemble the <a href="Math115_Quiz19_1113.pdf">one I gave to my Math 115</a> students in Fall 2017.
							I expect this to be a review from Precalculus, and that everyone should do well on it.
						</li>
						
						<li>HW2 and HW3 will go online starting 1/23. HW2 covers sections 1.5-1.6 and will be due on 1/28 at 11:59 PM. There will be a quiz
							on 1/29 over 1.5-1.6. HW3 covers section 2.2 and will be due on 1/30 at 11:59 PM. There will be a section 2.2 quiz on Thursday 1/31.

							<li>HW1 is now posted on MyMathLab and due on 1/24 at 11:59 PM. We will have our first quiz on 1/22 over sections 1.1-1.3. The homework is due after the quiz, to allow folks who added the class late time to complete the assignment.
							</li>
							
							<li>Here is the <a href="WS_1.1-1.3.pdf">Study Guide for Sections 1.1-1.3.</a> We have finished most of 1.1 and will hopefully get through 1.3. Note that we will neither be covering the unit circle nor introducing the basic six trig functions (sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot), as this should be a review from Precalculus. Please ask for help if this is not the case. You will have time 
							on Thursday in recitation to work through this study guide in groups and ask questions. I would encourage you to work through it 
							ahead of time, so that you can come prepared with questions.</li>
