						<strong>A Note About Quiz Days:</strong> I expect that everyone is working through the suggested problems in the book. On quiz days,
								I will spend the first few minutes of class discussing <strong>specific problems from the book that you wish to review (e.g., "I struggled with Problem 15 in Section 1.5. Can you review this?").
								I will NOT pick problems from the book to cover in class, as it eats up valuable review time and this is really your responsibility.

						<strong>Reminder:</strong> The exams will <strong>not</strong> be rescheduled for discretionary reasons, such as travel plans or family gatherings. Please make your travel plans accordingly.

					<li>The Math Tutoring Center is open from 10-4 Monday-Thursday, starting tomorrow. It is located in LeConte 105 (the room with the vending machines). You can walk in and get help from our Math graduate students; there is no need for an appointment.</li>

					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/23:</strong> My last day of office hours will be on Monday 4/29.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/17:</strong> 
						Here is a <a href="Final_Exam_Review.pdf">review packet for the final exam.</a> It is primarily composed of frequently missed questions for the exam. If you are looking for things on which to work, this is a good place to start.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/16:</strong> 
						HW17 over 6.4 is now posted. It is due on 4/22 at 11:59 PM. There will be an optional bonus quiz 5.6 and 6.4 on 4/23 in class. If this quiz is to your benefit, it will replace your lowest exam grade. Effectively, Blackboard will drop an extra quiz grade. Both 
						5.6 and 6.4 will be on the final exam, so it is to your benefit to attempt the quiz.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/9:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Here are the solutions to today's quiz: <a href="Quiz12A.pdf">Version A</a> and <a href="Quiz12B.pdf">Version B</a>.</li>
						<li>HW16 over 5.6 is due on 4/17 at 11:59 PM. You will NOT be responsible for 5.6, for Exam 3.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/2:</strong> HW13 over 6.6 was extended to 4/3 at 11:59 PM. The quiz over 6.6 was moved to 4/4.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>4/1:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>HW14 over 5.1-5.2 and HW15 over 5.4 go online tomorrow at noon. They are both due on 4/9 at 11:59 PM. Both HW14 and HW15 are quite short; their combined length is comparable to one usual homework assignment. If you need to bring up your homework average, this is a good opportunity to do so. </li>
						<li>There will be a quiz over 5.1-5.2 and 5.4 on 4/9 at the end of class. I will have your quizzes graded to pick up in office hours on 4/10, and I will post solutions online.</li>
						
						<li>Exam 3 is on Thursday, 4/11. It will cover 4.2-4.4, 6.2-6.3, 6.6, 5.1-5.2, and 5.4.</li>
						<li>Sections 5.6 and 6.4 will <strong>not</strong> be on Exam 3, but they will be on the Final Exam.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>3/21:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Based on today's quiz, folks still need practice with optimization problems. Therefore, there will be a second attempt at Quiz 9
							on 3/25. If you score higher on the second attempt, it will replace your first attempt. Similarly, if you are happy with your Quiz 9 grade, then you do not have to take the quiz on 3/25. You are welcome to stop by my office hours on Monday to pick up your graded quizzes.</p>
							
							<p>In light of the Quiz 9 retake, I have re-opened HW11. It is due on 3/25 at 11:59 PM. My expectation is that everyone will make 
							the effort to seek help and master the material prior to Tuesday. Note that Aaron will be going over today's quiz in SI on Monday. 
							You can also visit the Math Tutoring Center in LC 105 from 10-4 MTWR.
							</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>To help you study for the Quiz 9 retake, I have included solutions for today's quiz: <a href="Quiz9A.pdf">Version A</a> and <a href="Quiz9B.pdf">Version B</a>.</li>
