						<strong>A Note About Quiz Days:</strong> I expect that everyone is working through the suggested problems in the book. On quiz days,
								I will spend the first few minutes of class discussing <strong>specific problems from the book that you wish to review (e.g., "I struggled with Problem 15 in Section 1.5. Can you review this?").
								I will NOT pick problems from the book to cover in class, as it eats up valuable review time and this is really your responsibility.

							<li>For those of you who are presently without a graphing calculator, you may find <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">WolframAlpha</a>
								helpful for row-reducing matrices. Note that on a quiz/exam, you will need a graphing calculator to handle the matrix operations. The 
								TI-83 and TI-84 are highly recommended. The TI-89, TI-Inspire, and calculators with computer algebra systems (CAS) will not be allowed on quizzes/exams.
							</li>
							<li>Here is a <a href="http://cfcc.edu/faculty/cmoore/TI83MatrixOper.htm">reference</a> for the matrix operations on the TI-83 and TI-84. Make sure you are

								I will allow everyone to begin the exam at 4:15 PM and end at 5:40 PM. I will ask you to clear the memory on 
								your calculators as I hand out the exams. Please be prepared to have this ready as I walk by, as this will 
								allow me to hand out the exams faster.

							<li>It looks like LeConte will be closed all week. So today and Thursday, I will be holding make-shift office hours on the first floor of Swearingen (in the cafe, or one of the tables by the side entrances).
								On Wednesday, I will be on the first floor of the Close-Hipp building (space permitting, in the cafe area).</li>
							<li>Here is the <a href="7.5-7.6.pdf">Study Guide for 7.5-7.6.</a></li>	
							<li>HW6 over 7.5-7.6 will be available tonight starting at 6:00 PM. It is due on 10/8 at 11:59 PM. We will have a quiz over 7.5-7.6 on 10/9.</li>

					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/23:</strong> 
						<ul>
							<li>As a reminder, Exam 1 will be on 9/27. It covers 6.1-6.4 and 7.1-7.2. The Exam has 110 possible points; you will be graded out of 100 points.</li>
							<li>Class on Tuesday 9/25 will be a review day. Come prepared with questions and materials to review. You should have no shortage of problems (the study guides, old quizzes, old WebAssign homework, and suggested book problems).
								I will spend the first half of class answering questions at the board; quizzes from Thursday will be returned towards the end of class.
							</li>
							
							<li>To clarify, storing notes in your graphing calculator is considered an Honor Code Violation. On quiz days, I will be sampling students at random
								to clear the memory on their graphing calculators. On Exam days, I will need to see each student clear the memory on their graphing calculators before 
								receiving an exam. Anyone caught storing notes in their graphing calculators will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity, and I will recommend
								that you receive an F for the course.

							<li>HW5 over sections 7.3-7.4 is now posted. It is due on 10/3 at 11:59 PM. While Exam 1 will not test Sections 7.3-7.4, 
								these sections are closely related to 6.3-6.4. Therefore, working the HW5 problems is a good way to practice with the techniques
								that are being tested on Exam 1. </li>
							<li>We will have a quiz over 7.3-7.4 on 10/4.</li>
						</ul>	
					</li>
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/12:</strong> In light of class being cancelled all week, there are several announcements.
					<ul>
						<li> <p>As we have missed a week of class, we need to make up for lost time. Therefore, Section 7.1 will not be covered in lecture. You
							 are responsible for reading this section in the textbook. Note that Section 7.1 basically rehashes Section 6.1 on Set Theory, but in the 
							 language of Probability. Here is the <a href="7.1-7.3.pdf">Study Guide for Sections 7.1-7.3.</a> </p>
						</li>
						
						<li> <p>HW4 over Sections 7.1-7.2 is due on Thursday 9/20 at 4:00 PM. This should provide ample time to get your questions answered 
							    in office hours or the Math Tutoring Center. Don't hesitate to reach out with questions on the material. </p>
						</li>
						
						<li> Quiz 3 over 6.4 (Permutations/Combinations) will be held on Tuesday 9/18. Quiz 4 over 6.4 (Poker Hands) and 7.1/7.2 will be on Thursday 9/20.</li>
						
						<li> Exam 1 was originally scheduled for Thursday 9/20. It is now scheduled for Thursday 9/27 and will cover sections 6.1-6.4 and 7.1-7.2.</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/10:</strong> In light of class being cancelled tomorrow, there are several announcements.
						<ul>
							<li>Quiz 3 over 6.4 (Permutations/Combinations) that was scheduled for 9/11 is now scheduled for our next day of class (which is tentatively 9/13). 
								Quiz 4 over 6.4 (Poker Hands) and 7.1/7.2 will be on the class immediately following Quiz 3.
							</li>
							
							<li>HW3 is still due tonight at 11:59 PM. 
								The due date for HW4 over 7.1-7.2 has been pushed to 9/17, and this may be pushed back more depending on cancellations. I do encourage you to start
								reading Sections 7.1-7.2. The material overlaps considerably with Sections 6.1-6.2.
							</li>
							
							<li>Section 7.3 will no longer be on Exam 1. I will let you know if the date for Exam 1 changes, as a result of inclement weather.</li>
							<li>My office hours tomorrow 9/11 have been cancelled, in light of campus closures.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/9:</strong> HW4 covering sections 7.1-7.2 is now posted, for those who want to look ahead. It is due on 9/13 at 4:00 PM (ahead of our quiz). 
						Also, note that Exam 1 is in two weeks, on Thursday 9/20.

							<li>HW3 covering 6.4 is now available on WebAssign. It is due on 9/10. We will cover the rest of 6.4 (Combinations, Poker Hands) next class.</li>
							<li>We will have a quiz on 6.4 (Permutations, Combinations) on 9/11, and a quiz on 6.4 (Poker Hands) and 7.1/7.2 on 9/13.</li>
							
							<li>
								<p>As a reminder, attendance is taken every day there is a quiz/exam and every day that graded work is handed back. 
								Per the syllabus, if you miss more than 4 classes, your grade will be lowered by half a letter grade. Moving forward, graded work and quizzes
								will be given at the end of class. So if you leave early, you will be marked absent. If you have a legitimate reason to leave early, talk to me
								before class. Note that catching a shuttle, extracurricular events, and conflicting work schedules do not qualify. </p>

							<li>Even though there are no classes on Monday 9/3 for Labor Day, I will be holding office hours as usual from 2:30-3:30 PM.</li>
							<li>Quiz 2 on 6.2-6.3 (we will emphasize Venn Diagrams from 6.2) will be on Thursday 9/6.</li>

							and they will be included on your homework due Friday evening. </li>
							
							<li>Here is the <a href="6.3-6.4.pdf">Worksheet/Study Guide for Sections 6.3-6.4.</a> We will start covering 6.3 next class. Please make sure to

							<p> Here is the <a href="6.1-6.2.pdf">worksheet from today</a>. Bring questions about Problem 1 to next class. If you are feeling ambitious, 
							you are welcome to get started on Problems 3-6, though we will discuss these more next class. Note that we will also discuss the material
							for Problem 2 next class. </p>
							
						    <p>This worksheet is your study guide for sections 6.1-6.2. It is intended to supplement the WebAssign homework 
							and suggested problems from the textbook. Rather than providing a study guide for each exam a week before the exam date,
							I am providing worksheets as we go, which serve as study guides for individual sections. My rationale for this is that if you 
							learn the material as you go, then studying for the exam should be a matter of maintenance. <strong>Unless stated otherwise,
							the worksheets will neither be collected nor graded. In particular, today's worksheet will neither be collected nor graded.</strong>	
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>We will have our first quiz on 8/30 over sections 6.1-6.2.</li>
						<li>HW1 is now posted on WebAssign and due on 8/31 at 11:59 PM. The homework is due after the quiz, to allow folks who added the class late time to complete the assignment. </li>
