						<strong>A Note About Quiz Days:</strong> I expect that everyone is working through the suggested problems in the book. On quiz days,
								I will spend the first few minutes of class discussing <strong>specific problems from the book that you wish to review (e.g., "I struggled with Problem 15 in Section 1.5. Can you review this?").
								I will NOT pick problems from the book to cover in class, as it eats up valuable review time and this is really your responsibility.
						</strong>
					</li>

						<strong>Reminder:</strong> Exam 2 is scheduled for 10/15, and Exam 3 is scheduled for 11/19 (the week of Thanksgiving). The 
						exams will <strong>not</strong> be rescheduled for discretionary reasons, such as travel plans or family gatherings. Please 
						make your travel plans accordingly.

						<li>HW16 is now posted. It is due on 11/29. There will be a quiz over 5.6 on 11/30. Folks need some extra practice with u-substitution, so this quiz 
							will stress u-substitution.</li>
						<li>HW17 will be available starting on 11/28. It will be due on 12/4, ahead of our bonus quiz on 12/5. The bonus quiz is completely optional. 
							If you do not wish to take it, then the grade will be dropped. If it is helpful, then it will effectively replace your lowest quiz grade.
							This will be implemented by having Blackboard drop your lowest three quiz grades.</li>
						<li>If it is to your advantage, the final exam will replace your lowest midterm.</li>
						<li>There will be no additional extra credit opportunities.</li>

							<li>Exam 1 is on 10/15. It will cover 2.1-2.5, 3.3-3.4, and 4.1.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>As a reminder, Exam 1 will be on 9/28. It covers 1.1-1.9 and 3.1-3.2. The Exam has 100 possible points; you will be graded out of 100 points.</li>
							<li>Class on Wednesday 9/26 will be a review day. Come prepared with questions and materials to review. You should have no shortage of problems (the study guides, old quizzes, old WileyPlus homework, and suggested book problems).</li>
							
							<li>To clarify, storing notes in your graphing calculator is considered an Honor Code Violation. On quiz days, I will be sampling students at random
								to clear the memory on their graphing calculators. On Exam days, I will need to see each student clear the memory on their graphing calculators before 
								receiving an exam. Anyone caught storing notes in their graphing calculators will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity, and I will recommend
								that you receive an F for the course.

					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/15:</strong> 
						<ul>
							<li> We will have class on Monday 9/17. Attendance will <strong>not</strong> be taken, and you will not be penalized for missing class. Make your decision to drive back based on safety.</li>
							<li> On Monday, we will be reviewing 1.7 and 1.8. Bring your questions. The quiz over 1.5-1.7 will be on Wednesday 9/19. We will not be reviewing for the quiz on Wednesday, as Monday is our review day. </li>
							<li> Following the spirit of things, my Tuesday office hours are un-cancelled. My office hours this week will be held as normal. </li>

							<li>HW3 has been extended to Tuesday 9/18 at 11:59 PM. Barring any more university closures, the assignment will not be extended further.
								To help you with this assignment, I have prepared some <a href="Notes_1.7.pdf">Notes for Section 1.7.</a>
							</li>
							<li>We are not covering 1.8 in lecture. You will still be responsible for this material as per the announcement from 9/12.</li>
							<li>My office hours for Tuesday 9/18 are cancelled. Instead, I will have office hours on Wednesday 9/19 from 2:30-4:30.</li>
							<li>Assuming that USC is open on Tuesday, the Math Tutoring Center will be open as well.</li>
							<li>The quiz over Section 1.5-1.7 will be held on Wednesday 9/19. Due to the recent class cancellations, we will not have time to review beforehand.</li>
							<li>The quiz over Sections 1.8-1.9 will still be held on Friday 9/21.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/12:</strong> In light of class being cancelled for the rest of the week, here are some announcements.
						<ul>
							<li> On Monday 9/17, we will have the quiz over Sections 1.5-1.7. I also intend to cover Section 1.8 on Monday. </li>
							<li> <p>Due to the cancellations, we need to find ways to make up for lost time. 
								 Therefore, Section 1.9 will not be covered in lecture. You will be responsible for learning the material on this section.
								 To assist you, I have prepared some <a href="Makeup_Notes.pdf">notes</a>, as well as the <a href="WS_1.8-1.9.pdf">Study Guide for Sections 1.8-1.9</a>. HW4 covering Sections 1.8-1.9 is now posted, and it is due
								 Thursday 9/20 at 11:59 PM. This provides ample time to get your questions answered in office hours, the Math Tutoring Center, SI, etc.
								 Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions on the material.</p></li>
							<li> <p>If class on Monday 9/17 is cancelled, the previous bullet point will also apply to Section 1.8. Note that I planned to cover Sections 1.8 and 1.9 together in a single day. 
								 Neither section contains a lot of material. </p></li>
							<li> We will have a quiz over 1.8-1.9 on Friday 9/21.</li>
							<li> <p>Exam 1 was originally scheduled for 9/24. It is now scheduled for Friday 9/28. This will provide ample time for you to study, to schedule quizzes, and (more importantly)
								 for me to grade and return them so you can use them to study for the exam. Note that the Exam 1 will still cover the same sections, as outlined on the syllabus.</p>
							</li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/11:</strong> I have extended HW3. It is now due on 9/13 at 11:59 PM. My office hours will resume once campus re-opens.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/10:</strong> In light of the campus closures, here are some announcements.
						<ul>
							<li>The quiz over 1.5-1.7 will be held on the first class when we return. Note that HW3 is still due tomorrow evening at 11:59 PM.</li> 
							<li>I also encourage you to start reading section 1.8 on function composition, as well as section 1.9 on direct/indirect proportionality.</li>
							<li>As it stands, I still expect to have Exam 1 on 9/24. If this changes, I will let you know.</li>
							<li>My office hours are cancelled for tomorrow.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/8:</strong> There will be a quiz over 1.5-1.7 on 9/12.</li>
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/6:</strong> 
						<ul>
							<li>HW3 is now posted on WileyPlus. It is due on 9/11 at 11:59 PM. </li>
							<li>Here is the <a href="WS_1.5-1.7.pdf">Study Guide for Sections 1.5-1.7.</a> Note that Problem 8 was the most frequently missed problem on Exam 1 last semester.</li>
							<li>The Math Tutoring Center is now open from 10-4 on Monday-Thursday. This is an excellent, free resource, staffed with Math graduate students (many of whom have taught Math 122). The Math Tutoring Center is on the first floor of LeConte, in the room with the vending machines.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>9/1:</strong> HW2 is now posted on WileyPlus. It is due on 9/6 at 11:59 PM. We will have a quiz on 1.3-1.4 on 9/7. 
						Also, even though there are no classes on Monday 9/3 for Labor Day, I will be holding office hours as usual from 2:30-3:30 PM.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/27:</strong>
						The <a href="WS_1.3-1.4.pdf">Study Guide for sections 1.3-1.4</a> has been uploaded. Make sure you have access to this worksheet
						for next class (either print it off in advance, or bring an electronic device to access it online). In general, I will not be providing
						hard-copies of the study guides.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/25:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li> The typos in the syllabi have been fixed. The revised versions have been uploaded to both Blackboard and the course website. 
							 In particular, note that Exam 2 is on October 15. Also, you have six allotted absences, rather than four absences. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<p> Here is the <a href="WS_1.1-1.2.pdf">worksheet for sections 1.1-1.2</a>. If you are in the 10:50-11:40 or 12:00-12:50 sections, please bring this worksheet to class on Monday;
								you should have a hard-copy from class (and if not, you can print one). If you are in the 9:40-10:30 section, I will hand this out on Monday.								
							</p>
							
						    <p>This worksheet is your study guide for sections 1.1-1.2. It is intended to supplement the WileyPlus homework 
							and suggested problems from the textbook. Rather than providing a study guide for each exam a week before the exam date,
							I am providing worksheets as we go, which serve as study guides for individual sections. My rationale for this is that if you 
							learn the material as you go, then studying for the exam should be a matter of maintenance. <strong>Unless stated otherwise,
							the worksheets will neither be collected nor graded. In particular, today's worksheet will neither be collected nor graded.</strong>	
							</p>
						</li>
						
						<li><strong>Late Adds:</strong> If you added the class late, please see Blackboard and the syllabus about getting set up with WileyPlus. 
						Also, please read over section 1.1 and make sure you are comfortable with the material. You are responsible for the material covered last class, 
						but do feel free to come to office hours with any questions you may have after going over the material. </li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>8/23:</strong> HW1 is now posted on WileyPlus and due on 8/31 at 11:59 PM. We will have our first quiz on 8/31 over sections 1.1-1.2.
						The homework is due after the quiz, to allow folks who added the class late time to complete the assignment.
