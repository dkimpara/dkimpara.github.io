						<strong>A Note About Quiz Days:</strong> I expect that everyone is working through the suggested problems in the book. On quiz days,
								I will spend the first few minutes of class discussing <strong>specific problems from the book that you wish to review (e.g., "I struggled with Problem 15 in Section 1.5. Can you review this?").
								I will NOT pick problems from the book to cover in class, as it eats up valuable review time and this is really your responsibility.

					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>Final Exam:</strong> The final exam is scheduled for December 11 from 9:00-11:30 AM in the Monday/Wednesday classroom. You are expected
						to take the Final Exam at the scheduled time. Make-ups will NOT be permitted, except in the case of documented emergencies. Oversleeping is NOT an emergency.
						The final exam will include questions from P.1 (only on rational numbers), and is otherwise cumulative for the portions of Chapters 1-11 <strong>that we have covered</strong>. While the final
						exam will not pull questions directly from P.2-P.6, the skills from those sections are necessary to solve problems in later sections. So make sure you 
						are comfortable with this material. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>12/3:</strong> We will finish up 11.2-11.3 on 12/4-12/5. We will use 12/6-12/7, as well as any extra time at the end of 12/5, as review days for the final exam.
						Come prepared with materials on which to work. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<p><strong>11/29:</strong> The quiz for 11/30 has been moved to Monday 12/4. It will still cover 7.1-7.3. I have made available the remaining homework assignments on MyMathLab. 
						The 11.1-11.2 assignments are due on 12/4, and the 11.3 assignment is due on 12/5. <br/></p>
						
						<p>There are also two homework assignments for 8.1 and 8.2, which are due on 12/7. The 8.1 and 8.2 assignments are <strong>optional bonus assignments</strong>,
						which will replace your lowest two homework assignments if this is to your benefit. If you have missed a couple homework assignments, this is a good way to make
						up for it. The 8.1-8.2 assignments cover solving systems of linear equations. I am assuming this is a review from high school, and your calculus instructors will
						expect you to know this next semester. Make sure you have a handle on this material before next semester. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. </p>
						
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>11/26:</strong> We have MyMathLab homework for 7.1 due on 11/29, MyMathLab 7.2 due on 11/30, and MyMathLab 7.3 due on 12/3. 
						We will have a quiz on 11/30, which will cover 7.1-7.2 and tentatively 7.3. 
					</li> 
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>Exam 3 will be on Tuesday November 21, the day before Thanksgiving break. You are expected to take Exam 3 on 11/21. Remember that 
						travel plans are NOT excused absences. Please plan accordingly. 
						
						<p>Exam 3 will cover sections 2.2-6.3.</p>
						</strong>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>11/16:</strong> The Exam on 11/21 will no longer cover 6.4. You will only be tested on 2.2-6.3 (though you are welcome to use material from
						6.4, provided you do so correctly). The MyMathLab 6.4 assignment is now due on 11/27, the Monday after Thanksgiving break.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>11/14:</strong> The MyMathLab 6.4 assignment is now due on 11/17. I have also prepared a <a href="Quiz20_1114.pdf">solution</a> to today's
						quiz. Note that for problems similar to Problem 1, it is helpful to draw and fill out a right triangle using SOHCAHTOA. In our particular case, we
						had enough information to deduce csc(theta) without drawing a right triangle. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>11/13:</strong> Solutions to the 6.2 worksheet are posted, under the Suggested Problems. There will be a quiz on 6.3 and 6.4 on 11/16. 
						The MyMathLab assignments for 6.3 and 6.4 will also be due on 11/16.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<p><strong>11/9:</strong> I have graded today's quiz. It seems that many of you have not internalized the unit circle or the six basic trig functions.
						If you did not do well on today's quiz, it is most likely a result of losing points on the 5.4 problems (e.g., evaluate csc(-\pi/3)). Therefore, we
						will have a quiz on Monday 11/13 over 5.4. There will be 5 questions. Remember that many problems from the quizzes and exams are chosen directly from
						homework problems. Today's quiz was no exception.  </p>
						
						<p>On Monday 11/13, you will have the day to continue working on the <a href="Section_62.pdf">6.2 identities handout.</a> A number of folks have
						indicated they are struggling with the 6.1-6.2 material. In light of this, as well as the upcoming Marine Science field trip which affects a lot of folks,
						there will be two attempts at Quiz 20 over 5.5, 6.1, and 6.2. I will give a quiz over 5.5, 6.1, and 6.2 on both Tuesday 11/14 and Wednesday 11/15. Only your best
						score on the two attempts will be counted. If you are happy with your score on Tuesday's attempt, you do not have to attempt the quiz again on Wednesday. 
						If you are out on either 11/14 or 11/15, you only get one attempt at Quiz 20. Note that as Monday is a review day, we will NOT be reviewing before the Quiz 20
						attempts on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
						
						<p>There will be a quiz on 6.3 and 6.4 on Thursday 11/16.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>11/7:</strong> There will be a quiz on 11/9 over 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4. The MyMathLab 6.1 and 6.2 assignments are due on 11/13, and there
						will be a quiz on 5.5, 6.1, and 6.2 on 11/14. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>11/5:</strong> The 5.3 and 5.4 MyMathLab assignments will be due on 11/9, and the 5.5 MyMathLab assignment will be due on 11/12. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>10/31:</strong> There will be a quiz on 4.2 and 4.3 on 11/2. The MyMathLab assignments for 5.1 and 5.2 are due on 11/6. We will also have a quiz over 5.2 on Monday 11/6, in which you will be given a 
						<a href="http://faculty.uca.edu/clarenceb/Courses/Fall%202015/Math%201392%20Trigonometry/BlankUnitCircle.pdf">unit circle</a> to complete. 
						You should be able to fill in the unit circle in under five minutes. Note that you will need to know the unit circle for the rest of your math career.
						Take the time to commit it to memory now. The investment will pay dividends. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>10/28:</strong> The MyMathLab 3.4 and 3.5 assignments are due on 10/31. We will also have a Spooky Halloween Quiz over 3.4 and 3.5 on 10/31.
						The MyMathLab 4.2 and 4.3 assignments are due on 11/2. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>10/22:</strong> The MyMathLab 2.5 assignment is due on 10/25, and the MyMathLab 3.2 assignment is due on 10/26. There will
						be a quiz over sections 2.4, 2.5, and 3.2 on 10/26.  
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>10/15:</strong> I will be out this week. I have arranged for subs to cover for me. You are expected to attend class,
						and you will be responsible for the material the subs cover (i.e., it will be on quizzes and tests)! As I will not be in town,
						my office hours for this week are cancelled. Don't hesitate to reach out via email with any questions regarding the material. <br/>
						
						<p style="margin-top:10px">The MyMathLab 2.2 assignment is due on 10/18. The MyMathLab 2.3 and 2.4 assignments will be due on 10/23. 
						Note that you will have a quiz on 2.2 and 2.3 on Wednesday. I intend to make this quiz easy. Good attendance and hard work on Monday
						and Tuesday are likely to result in an additional, undisclosed incentive regarding the quiz.</p>
						
						<strong>10/5:</strong> We covered how to identify functions in 2.1 today, and we will finish 2.1 on Monday. The MyMathLab assignment for
						2.1 is due on 10/10, and we will have a quiz on 2.1 on 10/10 as well. <br/>
						
						<p style="margin-top:10px">Exam 2 will be on Thursday 10/12. <strong>THE EXAM CANNOT
						BE MADE UP, EXCEPT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WITH DOCUMENTATION. OVERSLEEPING IS NOT AN EMERGENCY! YOU ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE EXAM ON 10/12.</strong> <br/>
						
						The exam will cover the following:
						<ul>
							<li>1.3: Everything</li>
							<li>1.4: Everything in the book, as well as lines tangent to curves (see the handout under the Suggested Problems)</li>
							<li>1.5: Everything</li>
							<li>1.6: Everything. (Folks are struggling to solve equations with two square roots. Therefore, you should expect such a problem on the exam!)</li>
							<li>1.7: Everything</li>
							<li>11.5: Be able to evaluate factorials and binomial coefficients. Be apply to expand a polynomial using the Binomial Theorem and determine the coefficient
							of a term in such an expansion.</li>
							
							<li>2.1: Everything</li>
						</ul>
						
						The book, MyMathLab, and your quizzes provide plenty of practice problems. Make sure you are working them and seeking help on the ones
						you don't understand. 
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>10/3:</strong> We finished 1.7 and most of 11.5. You should get started on the MyMathLab and suggested problems for these sections.
						The MyMathLab assignment for 11.5 is due on 10/8. We will have a quiz on 1.7 and 11.5 on Monday 10/9. <br/>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>10/2:</strong> There will be a quiz on 1.5-1.6 on 10/5. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/29:</strong> We have covered most of 1.6 and will finish the material in this section 
						on solving equations with rational expressions on Monday. The suggested problems for 1.6 are posted, and the
						1.6 MyMathLab assignment is due on 10/4. The MyMathLab 1.7 assignment is due on 10/6.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/27:</strong> I have updated the 1.4 suggested problems to include the worksheet on finding lines tangent to curves. Note that 
						you will ONLY be assessed on Problems 1(a)-(d) of that worksheet. I have also made available the MyMathLab 1.5 assignment, which is due on
						10/2.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/23:</strong> The MyMathLab assignments for 1.3 and 1.4 have been posted. The 1.3 assignment is due on 9/27, and we will
						have a quiz on 1.3 on 9/27. You should be able to start working through the MyMathLab assignment and suggested book problems for 1.3,
						and we will finish 1.3 on Monday. The MyMathLab 1.4 assignment is due on 10/1. We will have a quiz on 1.4 on 10/2.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/14:</strong> The quiz for today on P.5 (factoring by substitution) and all of P.6 was moved to Monday 9/18, so that
						everyone has more time to study. I have also extended the due date for the P.6 MyMathLab assignment to Sunday 9/17 at 11:59 PM.
						Note that the quiz over P.1 and P.2 will still be held on Tuesday 9/19, so that I can return your graded quizzes on Wednesday.
						Remember that Exam 1 is on Thursday 9/21.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/13:</strong> We will have a quiz over 1.1 and 1.2 on Tuesday 9/19. Exam 1 will be on Thursday 9/21. <strong>THE EXAM CANNOT
						BE MADE UP, EXCEPT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WITH DOCUMENTATION. OVERSLEEPING IS NOT AN EMERGENCY! YOU ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE THE EXAM ON 9/21.</strong> <br/>
						
						The exam will cover the following:
						<ul>
							<li>P.1: You should be able to recognize if a real number is rational or irrational. If a number is rational, write it in fraction form.
							If it is irrational, justify why this is the case.</li>
							
							<li>P.2: Everything, except for scientific notation.</li>
							<li>P.3-P.4: Everything</li>
							<li>P.5: Make sure you can SHOW YOUR WORK when factoring polynomials. (A lot of folks struggled on factoring a sum or difference of perfect cubes
							on today's quiz. You may use any mathematically correct method to factor polynomials; including, but not limited to, polynomial long division and the
							method from class. Note that the method from class will arise repeatedly throughout the semester. So the sooner you master this, the better you will be).</li>
							
							<li>P.6, 1.1, 1.2: Everything</li>
						</ul>
						
						The book, MyMathLab, and your quizzes provide plenty of practice problems. Make sure you are working them and seeking help on the ones
						you don't understand. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/12:</strong> We will finish covering 1.1 and 1.2, hopefully by the end of the week (and no later than Monday 9/18). The
						MyMathLab 1.1 and 1.2 assignments are posted. The MyMathLab 1.1 assignment is due on 9/18, and the 1.2 assignment is due on 9/20. You 
						should start on these and the suggested book problems as we cover the material.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/8:</strong> Class on Monday and Tuesday (9/11-9/12) has been <strong>CANCELED</strong> due to the hurricane. The 
						<a href="http://www.sc.edu/uofsc/weather/">USC Weather Site</a> has information regarding cancellations, as well as services
						the university is offering. In particular, the dining halls, health and counseling centers, and (yes!) the library will still
						be open. Stay safe and stay dry! If you are planning on leaving town, I would do so tomorrow. You should expect heavy traffic.
						</p>
						
						<p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						Per University policy: <em>Students should be aware that work must be made up and be prepared to do so. It is the university’s intention to adhere to the planned academic calendar, including fall break. </em>
						In the interests of time, I will <strong>NOT</strong> be covering the following material in class, <strong>for which you will STILL BE RESPONSIBLE</strong>.
						This means any of the topics listed below <strong>WILL BE ON QUIZZES AND EXAMS</strong>.
						<ul>
							<li>Section P.5: factoring by substitution </li>
							<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
								Section P.6: Finding the domain of a rational expression, reducing rational expressions, and adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing rational
								expressions. 
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						
						<p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						I expect that this material is mostly a review. If this is not the case, <strong>you are responsible for seeking help, such as by coming to my office hours,
						emailing me, visiting the Math tutoring center, etc.!</strong> I will not be holding office hours on Monday; however, I will be holding office hours from 
						3:15 PM-4:15 PM on Tuesday instead. I will also have my normal Wednesday office hours. You are also welcome and encouraged to email me questions, as well 
						as to set up an appointment to meet if my office hours are not convenient. 
						</p>
						
						<p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						Note that the quiz on Tuesday will be on Wednesday 9/13, and the quiz for Thursday will be held as scheduled. We have covered everything for Wednesday's quiz already. 
						The material I will not be covering is going to be tested on Thursday's quiz. This gives you time to seek help. <strong>You should take advantage of your long weekend
						to work through the MyMathLab assignments and suggested book problems for P.5 and P.6 (only the material I am not covering in class, for P.6), so you can take advantage of my office hours
						next week!</strong>
						</p>
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/7:</strong> As of today, we have finished all of P.5 except for factoring by substitution. You should start working on the
						suggested problems and MyMathLab assignment for P.5. I have extended the deadline for the MyMathLab P.5 assignment to 9/12 and the MyMathLab P.6 assignment to 9/14. 
						On Tuesday 9/12, we will have a quiz over all of P.4 and P.5 (except for factoring by substitution). On Thursday 9/14, there 
						will be a quiz on all of P.5 and P.6. Note that if class is cancelled on a quiz day due to the hurricane, then we will have the quiz on 
						the next day of class. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>9/4:</strong> We have several announcements. First, I have made available several MyMathLab assignments. 
						The MyMathLab assignments for P.3 and P.4 are due on 9/7. The MyMathLab assignment for P.5 is due on 9/10, and the 
						MyMathLab assignment for P.6 is due on 9/12. Note that we have finished covering P.3 and will begin with P.4 tomorrow. <br/>
						
						The second announcement is that SI review sessions begin <strong>this week!</strong> Check out the 
						<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/uscsupplementalinstruction/">SI schedule</a>. Note that you should be spending
						<strong>3 HOURS EACH WEEK</strong> attending SI! The SI program has been tremendously successful in helping students
						master the material and improve their grades substantially (in many instances, even a full letter grade). 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>8/31:</strong> We have finished covering P.3. Please start working on the suggested book problems for P.3 (scroll all the way down),
						as well as the MyMathLab problems for P.3. We will have a quiz on Thursday, September 7 over all of P.3 and part of P.4 (adding and multiplying
						polynomials, determining the degree of a polynomial, and knowing what the leading coefficient is). It will also be advantageous to have my
						office hours committed to memory by Thursday. Hint, hint, hint.
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>8/30:</strong> As of today, I expect that everyone has MyMathLab. Your first two MyMathLab assignments (for P.1 and P.2) are due
						on 9/3. The assignments for P.3 and P.4 are due 9/7. We have covered some of P.3 today in class (rational exponents, using absolute values
						to simplify radical expressions). Note that tomorrow's quiz will NOT assess on using absolute values in simplifying radical expressions. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>8/27:</strong> I have set up MyMathLab. You should be able to get started on Section P1 Homework, and you will be able
						to complete it after class on Monday 8/28. As I do not expect folks to have access to MyMathLab until Wednesday, the homework
						will not be due until Sunday 9/3. 
					</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>8/27:</strong> We will have a quiz on Thursday, August 31. It will cover the remainder of section P1 that was
						not assessed on the first quiz, as well as P2. Problem 3 on the <a href="HW1_Suggested.pdf">HW1 Suggested Problems</a> 
						and the suggested book problems for both P1 and P2 are fair game. 
					</li>
				
					<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						<strong>8/24:</strong>Complete the <a href="HW1_Suggested.pdf">HW1 Suggested Problems</a> by Tuesday, August 29. You should be able to 
						work Problems 1-2 based on class today. We will have a quiz on Tuesday at the end of class over Problems 1-2. 
						Note that the deadline to drop the course without receiving a grade of W is Wednesday, August 30. 
					</li>
					
					<li><strong>8/24:</strong> Obtain a copy of MyMathLab and the Course Textbook by August 30.</li>

						that f is increasing at c. If f'(c) < 0, then f is decreasing at c. If f'(c) = 0, then f is constant at c. You are welcome to use this fact
						on quizzes and tests. Remember that we f'(x) is obtained by simplifying the difference quotient [f(x+h)-f(x)]/h, then plugging in h = 0.
